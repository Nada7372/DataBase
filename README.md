# Supermarket Database Project

This project is a relational database system for managing and analyzing supermarket operations. It was developed as part of a university assignment using **SQL Server** and includes database design, implementation, and data analysis through SQL queries.

## 🧾 Project Description

The **Supermarket Database** is designed to manage various aspects of a supermarket, such as:
- Cities and Branches
- Customers and their types
- Products and purchases (Invoices)
- Payment methods
- Ratings and reviews
- Date and time tracking

The database also supports detailed analysis using **views** and **SQL queries**.

## 🗂️ Database Structure

The database includes the following tables:

- `Cities`
- `Branches`
- `Customers`
- `Products`
- `Invoices`
- `Payments`
- `Dates`
- `Ratings`

All relationships are set using **foreign keys**, and the design follows normalization rules.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- T-SQL
- GitHub for version control and sharing

## 💾 Features

- **Create Tables** with appropriate relationships
- **Insert sample data** for simulation
- **Analytical Queries** using GROUP BY, JOIN, and aggregations
- **Multiple Views** for summarized and detailed reporting
- Example: `FullInvoiceDetails`, `View_SalesSummary`, `View_InvoiceDetailsWithCityName`

## 📊 Example Queries

- Total sales by branch and city
- Average ratings by city
- Products purchased by category
- Most used payment methods
- Invoice details by customer and gender

*(You can drag & drop your ERD and Schema images here directly in GitHub)*

## 🧪 How to Use

1. Open SQL Server.
2. Run the script `SQLQuery1.sql` to create and populate the database.
3. Use the queries in the file to analyze and visualize the data.
